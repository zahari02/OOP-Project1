In A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking attempts to explain a range of subjects 
in cosmology, including the Big Bang, black holes and light cones, to the non-specialist
reader. His main goal is to give an overview of the subject, but he also attempts
to explain some complex mathematics. In the 1996 edition of the book and subsequent
editions, Hawking discusses the possibility of time travel and wormholes and explores 
the possibility of having a Universe without a quantum singularity at the beginning of time.
Chapter 1: Our Picture of the Universe
In the first chapter, Hawking discusses the history of astronomical studies, 
including the ideas of Aristotle and Ptolemy. Aristotle, unlike many other people 
of his time, thought that the Earth was round. He came to this conclusion 
by observing lunar eclipses, which he thought were caused by the Earth's round shadow, 
and also by observing an increase in altitude of the North Star from the perspective 
of observers situated further to the north. Aristotle also thought that the Sun 
and stars went around the Earth in perfect circles, because of "mystical reasons". 
Second-century Greek astronomer Ptolemy also pondered the positions of the Sun 
and stars in the Universe and made a planetary model that described 
Aristotle's thinking in more detail.
Today, it is known that the opposite is true: the Earth goes around the Sun. 
The Aristotelian and Ptolemaic ideas about the position of the stars and Sun 
were overturned by a series of discoveries in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. 
The first person to present a detailed argument that the Earth revolves around the Sun 
was the Polish priest Nicholas Copernicus, in 1514. Nearly a century later, 
Galileo Galilei, an Italian scientist, and Johannes Kepler, a German scientist, 
studied how the moons of some planets moved in the sky, and used their observations 
to validate Copernicus's thinking.
