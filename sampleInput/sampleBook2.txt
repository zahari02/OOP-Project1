THE PROCESS of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially attrac-
tive, not only because it can be economically and scientifically rewarding, but
also because it can be an aesthetic experience much like composing poetry or
music. This book is the first volume of a multi-volume set of books that has been
designed to train the reader in various skills that go into a programmer's craft.
The following chapters are not meant to serve as an introduction to computer programming;
the reader is supposed to have had some previous experience. The
prerequisites are actually very simple, but a beginner requires time and practice
in order to understand the concept of a digital computer. The reader should
possess:
a) Some idea of how a stored-program digital computer works; not necessarily
the electronics, rather the manner in which instructions can be kept in the
machine's memory and successively executed.
b) An ability to put the solutions to problems into such explicit terms that a
computer can "understand" them. (These machines have no common sense;
they do exactly as they are told, no more and no less. This fact is the
hardest concept to grasp when one first tries to use a computer.)
c) Some knowledge of the most elementary computer techniques, such as loop-
ing (performing a set of instructions repeatedly), the use of subroutines, and
the use of indexed variables.
d) A little knowledge of common computer jargon- "memory," "registers,"
"bits," "floating point," "overflow," "software." Most words not defined in
the text are given brief definitions in the index at the close of each volume.
These four prerequisites can per haps be summed up into the single requirement
that the reader should have already written and tested at least, say, four pro-
grams for at least one computer.
